##Â An extensive analysis of the headlines of The Irish Times published in 2019

An extensive analysis of the news headlines published in 2019 by *The Irish Times*. The findings will certainly be related to events occured in Ireland, UK and, more in general, Europe and to reach this goal I will try to find the recurrent topics exploiting both LDA and matrix factorization. I will also use clustering to look for patterns in the headlines, and finally I will analyze the most important terms in the documents and create embeddings of the them.
